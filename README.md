This mod adds a cooking system that is similar to Overcooked. There are currently 4 main dishes you can make with this mod. Here is a list of them:

- **Burgers**: Cut a beef to get a patty, cut bread to get buns, cook the patty and put them in a plate. You can also add cheese, lettuce and tomato (all unobtainable in survival at the moment).
- **Fries**: Cut a potato and fry it, that's it.
- **Salad**: Cut some tomatoes and lettuces and mix them in a plate.
- **Burrito**: Dice a beef or a chicken, cook some rice and put them together with a tortilla made from flour.

You can see all recipes using [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/rei) mod.

This mod is currently in really, REALLY early development. If you have any ideas or find any bugs, create an issue about it on [github](https://github.com/efekos/CookLikeActually).
